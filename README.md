# minimablog
Minimablog is a minimalistic and easy to use blog CMS open and free for everyone to use. It's made for the people who just want to set up a blog and start creating content without having to learn a new layout and system.

## Motivation
Why we created minimablog was because we couldn't find a super simple and minimalistic easy to use blog CMS on the market. Therefore we created our own and we made it opensource since we love opensource and so others could enjoy this simple and minimalistic blog CMS. This blog CMS is for the people who just want to create quality content and not have to deal with all of the clutter with other blog CMS options.
